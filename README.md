# Better World Options

This mod brings modern Minecraft features to the nostalgic Beta 1.7.3 experience by introducing **Hardcore Mode** and **World Types**. It enhances the classic gameplay while preserving the original feel of the game.

  * Nether
  * Skylands
  * Flat
  * Farlands
  * Beta 1.1_02
  * Alpha 1.1.2_01
  * Infdev 420
